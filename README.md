## AdventureWorkPowerBIReport

### Objective:
The primary goal of this project was to address key business challenges faced by Adventure Works, a global leader in manufacturing cycling equipment and accessories. The BI report was designed to effectively track KPIs including sales, revenue, profit, and returns, while also comparing regional performance, analyzing product-level trends, and identifying high-value customers.

**Steps Followed:**

**STAGE 1: Connecting & Shaping Data**
In this initial phase, I utilized Power Query and various data connectors to extract, transform, and load the data. This involved several table transformation techniques such as grouping, aggregating, merging, and appending to ensure the data was well-prepared for analysis. I also carefully anlyzed column data for data format, data values range check, date check, null value transformation, checked for duplicate records and made sure data is cleaned and is in right shape for building data model.

**STAGE 2: Creating a Relational Data Model**
Here, I developed a relational data model to establish connections between Fact and Dimension tables, considering cardinality, filter-flow, and normalization to optimize data retrieval and analysis.

**STAGE 3: Adding Calculated Fields with DAX**
In this stage, I employed Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to create calculated columns and measures related to different product, revenue, profit, order and return level KPIs. This allowed for complex calculations and queries, providing deeper insights into the data.

**STAGE 4: Visualizing Data with Reports**
The final stage involved translating the data into engaging and interactive reports, dashboards, and KPI cards to present data for customers, product, region and revenue level information. I applied best practices to ensure the visualizations were not only attractive but also user-friendly and informative.
I am excited to share this project with the community and look forward to any feedback or discussions it may inspire!
