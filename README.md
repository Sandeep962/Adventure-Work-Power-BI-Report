‚≠ê Steps Followed: ‚≠ê

‚ö° STAGE 1: Connecting & Shaping Data
In this initial phase, I utilized Power Query and various data connectors to extract, transform, and load the data. This involved several table transformation techniques such as grouping, aggregating, merging, and appending to ensure the data was well-prepared for analysis.

‚ö° STAGE 2: Creating a Relational Data Model
Here, I developed a relational data model to establish connections between multiple tables, considering cardinality, filter-flow, and normalization to optimize data retrieval and analysis.

‚ö° STAGE 3: Adding Calculated Fields with DAX
In this stage, I employed Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to create calculated columns and measures. This allowed for complex calculations and queries, providing deeper insights into the data.

‚ö° STAGE 4: Visualizing Data with Reports
The final stage involved translating the data into engaging and interactive reports, dashboards, and KPI cards. I applied best practices to ensure the visualizations were not only attractive but also user-friendly and informative.
I am excited to share this project with the community and look forward to any feedback or discussions it may inspire! üåü Maven Analytics
